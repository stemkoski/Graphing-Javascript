graph.html: simple grapher of points and/or segments; includes class ParametricCurve

graph-2.html: rewrite using math.js (https://mathjs.org/): allows coordinate function input as strings

graph-3.html: added ParametricCurve function getEquispacedPoints(numPoints), includes calculating segment lengths and estimating total arclength from beginning of curve to each point (needed to generate equally spaced points)

graph-4.html: lots of name changes. Vertex: data structure that contains position, etc. 
calculate and graph tangent and normal vectors to curve at sample points. 

graph-5.html: redo graph-4, add percentArclength parameter in [0,1] to each vertex in array; automatically generate an internal vertex array for a function, refactor binary search into getVertexAtPercentArclength, requires lots of lerping, and then redo getEquispacedVertexArray
